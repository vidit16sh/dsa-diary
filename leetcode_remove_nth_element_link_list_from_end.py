Question:
Leetcode 19 â€“ Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a singly linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list 
and return its head.

---

ðŸ§  Approach: Two-Pointer Technique (Fast & Slow Pointers)

1. Use a dummy node pointing to the head to simplify edge cases (e.g., removing the head itself).
2. Move the `right` pointer `n` steps ahead of the `left` pointer.
3. Then move both pointers one step at a time until `right` reaches the end.
4. Now `left` is just before the node to remove. Update `left.next` to skip the target node.

Why use a dummy?
- It simplifies handling the case where the head node itself needs to be removed.

Time Complexity: O(n) â€” traverse the list once  
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” constant extra space

Example:
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
