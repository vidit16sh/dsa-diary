Question:
Leetcode 76 - Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`.
If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return an empty string `""`.

---

Approach: Sliding Window + Hash Maps

- Use two dictionaries:
  - `h1` to store frequency of each character in `t`
  - `h2` to store frequency of characters in the current window of `s`
- Expand the right pointer `r` across `s` and update `h2`.
- For every character `c` in `t`, when `h2[c]` matches `h1[c]`, we increment `e2`.
- When all required characters are matched (`e1 == e2`), try to shrink the window from the left (`l`) while still valid.
- Keep track of the minimum window size and its start/end positions.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `s`  
Space Complexity: O(1), since character set is fixed (only ASCII letters)

Test Case:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"  
Output: "BANC"  
Explanation: The minimum window substring that contains A, B, and C is "BANC".
