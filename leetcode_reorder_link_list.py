Question:
Leetcode 143 â€“ Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked list.  
Reorder the list to follow the pattern:
    L0 â†’ Ln â†’ L1 â†’ Ln-1 â†’ L2 â†’ Ln-2 â†’ â€¦

Do not modify the values in the nodes, only the node connections may be changed.
Modify the list in-place.

---

ðŸ§  Approach:

1. **Find the middle** of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. **Reverse** the second half of the list.
3. **Merge** the two halves, alternating nodes from the first and reversed second half.

---

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” in-place modifications

Example:
Input: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4  
Output: 1 â†’ 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 3
